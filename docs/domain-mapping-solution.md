# Domain Mapping Solution

## Problem
The email processing system was receiving emails but couldn't map them to JIRA boards because the domain-to-organization mapping wasn't implemented in the email processor.

## Root Cause
The `EmailProcessor` was calling `aiAgentService.processEmail()` without providing `userId` and `organizationId` fields, which are required to enable JIRA operations.

## Solution Overview

### 1. **Domain Lookup Service** (`src/domain/domain-lookup.service.ts`)
- Extracts domain from email address (`user@example.com` ‚Üí `example.com`)
- Queries `domain_configurations` table for verified domains
- Returns organization and user context if domain is verified

### 2. **Updated Email Processor** (`src/queue/processors/email.processor.ts`)
- Uses `DomainLookupService` to find organization/user context
- Passes context to AI agent to enable JIRA operations
- Provides clear logging for debugging

### 3. **Debug Endpoints** (`src/domain/domain.controller.ts`)
- Test domain lookup functionality
- Check verification status
- List all verified domains

## How It Works

```mermaid

    participant Email as Incoming Email
    participant Processor as Email Processor
    participant Domain as Domain Lookup Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant AI as AI Agent
    participant JIRA as JIRA Service

    Email->>Processor: from: ceo@vidova.ai
    Processor->>Domain: findOrganizationByEmailDomain()
    Domain->>DB: Query domain_configurations
    DB-->>Domain: organization + user data
    Domain-->>Processor: { organizationId, userId, ... }
    Processor->>AI: processEmail() with context
    AI->>JIRA: Create/update tickets
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Domain Configuration Required
Before emails can be processed with JIRA integration, the domain must be:
1. **Added** to an organization
2. **Verified** via email confirmation
3. **Linked** to JIRA configuration

### 2. Verification Process
```sql
-- Check if domain is verified
SELECT * FROM domain_configurations 
WHERE domain = 'vidova.ai' 
AND verification_status = 'verified';

-- See organization details
SELECT 
  dc.domain,
  dc.verification_status,
  org.name,
  org.jira_base_url,
  org.jira_project_key
FROM domain_configurations dc
JOIN organizations org ON dc.organization_id = org.id
WHERE dc.domain = 'vidova.ai';
```

## Testing the Solution

### 1. Check Domain Verification Status
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/domain/check/vidova.ai"
```

### 2. Test Domain Lookup
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/domain/lookup/ceo@vidova.ai"
```

### 3. List All Verified Domains
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/domain/verified"
```

### 4. Process Test Email
Send a test email through Postmark webhook and check logs for:
```
üîç Looking up organization for domain: vidova.ai
üè¢ Found organization: Vidova AI (org-uuid)
üë§ Using user: CEO Name (user-uuid)
‚úÖ JIRA integration available for organization: org-uuid
```

## Expected Log Output

### Before Fix (No JIRA Integration)
```
[AiAgentService] Processing email with AI: Re:
[AiAgentService] No user/organization context provided - JIRA operations will be disabled
```

### After Fix (With JIRA Integration)
```
[EmailProcessor] Processing email from: ceo@vidova.ai, subject: Re:
[DomainLookupService] üîç Looking up organization for domain: vidova.ai
[DomainLookupService] ‚úÖ Domain lookup successful: vidova.ai ‚Üí Org: Vidova AI (org-id), User: CEO (user-id)
[EmailProcessor] üè¢ Found organization: Vidova AI (org-id)
[EmailProcessor] üë§ Using user: CEO Name (user-id)
[AiAgentService] Processing email with AI: Re:
[AiAgentService] ‚úÖ JIRA integration available for organization: org-id
```

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Found
If you see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No verified domain configuration found for email: ceo@vidova.ai
üí° JIRA operations will be disabled. To enable JIRA integration, the domain needs to be verified.
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify the domain is in `domain_configurations` table
2. Check `verification_status = 'verified'`
3. Ensure organization has JIRA configuration
4. Use debug endpoints to diagnose

### Common Issues

1. **Domain Not Verified**
   - Use `/auth/verify-domain/initiate` API
   - Check verification email
   - Confirm via email link or manual code

2. **Organization Missing JIRA Config**
   - Ensure `jira_base_url` and `jira_project_key` are set
   - Verify Atlassian OAuth tokens are valid

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check Supabase configuration
   - Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## API Endpoints

### Debug Endpoints
- `GET /domain/lookup/:email` - Test domain lookup
- `GET /domain/verified` - List verified domains  
- `GET /domain/check/:domain` - Check verification status

### Production Endpoints
- `POST /auth/verify-domain/initiate` - Start verification
- `POST /auth/verify-domain/confirm` - Complete verification
- `GET /auth/domains/status` - Check organization domains

## Security Notes

- Domain verification prevents unauthorized email routing
- Only verified domains can trigger JIRA operations
- Organization owners are used as default context
- All operations are logged for audit trails

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Email**: Send email from verified domain
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for successful domain lookup
3. **Verify JIRA Integration**: Confirm tickets are created
4. **Add More Domains**: Verify additional domains as needed
