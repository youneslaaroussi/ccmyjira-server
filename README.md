## üìß Postmark Features & Integration

| Postmark Feature | How We Use It |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Inbound Webhooks** | All incoming emails to `hello@send.ccmyjira.com` are parsed and POSTed to our API for processing (attachments, HTML, etc). |
| **Immediate Response** | Webhook returns 200 OK instantly, then processes via Redis/BullMQ background jobs - prevents Postmark timeouts |
| **Outbound Email** | Sends domain verification emails (React Email templates) and JIRA notifications from `noreply@ccmyjira.com`. |
| **Inbound Domain Forwarding** | We use Postmark's inbound domain to use our own address: send.ccmyjira.com |
| **Custom Sender Domain** | All outbound emails use our verified sender domain: `noreply@ccmyjira.com`. |

### üöÄ Webhook Processing Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PM as Postmark
    participant WH as Webhook Controller
    participant Q as Redis Queue
    participant BG as Background Worker
    participant AI as GPT-4o Agent
    participant JIRA as JIRA API

    PM->>WH: POST /webhooks/postmark
    Note over WH: Validate payload
    WH->>Q: Queue job
    WH-->>PM: 200 OK (immediate)
    Note over PM: Webhook complete<br/>~50ms response time
    
    Q->>BG: Process job
    BG->>AI: Start AI workflow
    
    loop Multiple Tool Calls (3-8 rounds)
        AI->>AI: GPT-4o reasoning (2-8s)
        AI->>JIRA: Tool call (search/create/update)
        JIRA-->>AI: Response
    end
    
    Note over BG: Total: 15-60+ seconds<br/>Would timeout webhook!
```

**Why This Matters for Postmark:**
- **AI Processing Takes 15-60+ Seconds**: Our GPT-4o agent makes 3-8 tool calls per email (search JIRA ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí create/update ‚Üí assign). Each OpenAI API call takes 2-8 seconds, plus JIRA API calls.
- **Webhook Timeout Prevention**: Postmark expects responses under 10 seconds - we respond in ~50ms, then let background workers handle the heavy AI processing
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Can run multiple BullMQ workers across containers/servers. High email volumes automatically distribute across available workers.
- **Reliable Delivery**: Failed AI processing doesn't affect email receipt acknowledgment - emails never get lost
- **Error Resilience**: Background jobs retry with exponential backoff if OpenAI hits rate limits or JIRA APIs are slow

## üèóÔ∏è Key Features

![Example JIRA Ticket](./images/deepshotinc.atlassian.net_browse_BTS-13.png)

| Category | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| ü§ñ **AI-Powered Intelligence** | Email Analysis | GPT-4o understands context and technical content |
| | Non-linear Processing | Updates existing tickets when appropriate |
| | Smart Assignment | Routes based on skills, workload, and mentions |
| | Multi-round Conversations | Complex workflows with tool calling |
| üé´ **Advanced JIRA Integration** | Search-first Approach | Prevents duplicate tickets |
| | Sprint Awareness | Automatic assignment and due dates |
| | Rich Formatting | Preserves email styling in descriptions |
| | Attachment Handling | Automatic file uploads with context |

## üîê Enterprise-Grade Multi-Tenant Security

### Domain-Based Email Routing
```typescript
// Actual implementation from domain-lookup.service.ts
const { data: domainConfig, error: domainError } = await this.supabaseService.client
  .from('domain_configurations')
  .select(`
    *,
    organization:organizations!inner(
      id, name, jira_base_url, jira_project_key, jira_cloud_id, owner_id
    )
  `)
  .eq('domain', domain)
  .eq('verification_status', 'verified')
  .single();
```

| Security Layer | Implementation | Postmark Integration |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Domain Verification** | Multi-step verification process with email confirmation via Postmark | Only emails from verified domains create tickets in corresponding tenant |
| **Supabase RLS** | Built-in Supabase Row Level Security isolates tenant data automatically | Prevents cross-tenant data access at database level |
| **Token Management** | Atlassian OAuth tokens stored securely in Supabase with refresh handling | Tokens scoped per organization preventing cross-tenant access |
| **Request Context** | Domain lookup validates sender before processing | Webhook processing includes tenant lookup from sender domain |
| **Demo Mode Fallback** | Secure demo environment when domain verification unavailable | Unknown domains route to isolated demo JIRA instance |

### Postmark Security Integration
- **Webhook Validation**: HMAC signature verification for all inbound emails
- **Domain-Based Routing**: Only emails from verified domains create tickets in corresponding tenant
- **SPF/DKIM Enforcement**: Postmark's built-in email authentication prevents spoofing
- **Attachment Scanning**: All attachments validated for malicious content before JIRA upload

## ü§ñ AI Agent Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Context Awareness** | Tracks email threads, avoids duplicate tickets, updates existing tickets as needed |
| **Assignment & Roles** | Fetches org users/roles, assigns tickets, updates metadata (priority, status), manages sprints |
| **Multi-Message Chains** | Handles long email histories, not just single messages |
| **Smart Actions** | Decides when to create, update, assign, or comment on tickets |

---

### üéØ Smart Assignment System

![Smart Assignment System](./images/SmartAssignmentDiagram.png)

Our AI agent doesn't just create tickets‚Äîit intelligently assigns them based on:

| Factor | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **Team Workload** | Analyzes current ticket counts, story points, and overdue items per team member |
| **Skill Matching** | Routes React bugs to frontend developers, database issues to backend specialists |
| **Priority Routing** | Critical P0 issues automatically go to senior team members |
| **@Mention Recognition** | Honors explicit assignments when team members are mentioned in emails |
| **Sprint Context** | Considers active sprints and capacity when making assignments |

**A trace of the agent's actions is logged to console when you run in dev mode!**
